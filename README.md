# 🧠 W3Resource C++ Exercises Repository

> "Repetition builds mastery and mastery builds freedom."

This repository contains my complete, structured solutions to the **W3Resource C++ Programming Exercises**, organized by topic.  
Each solution is written in **modern C++17/20**, tested, and documented for clarity and learning.

## 📘 Purpose

The goal of this project is to **master C++ fundamentals through deliberate practice**.  
I aim to sharpen my understanding of algorithms, memory management, data structures, and OOP concepts by completing hundreds of progressively harder exercises.
